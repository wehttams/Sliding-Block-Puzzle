The code is divided into 3 separate java files. A gameplay file, an interactive mode file, and a validation mode file. 


The gameplay file contains 99% of the underlying code of the program. Within it there are 2 classes: the puzzle class, and the public gameplay class. 


The puzzle class contains all the methods used to generate the puzzles of different modes and difficulties. The PuzzlePrinter method prints out the puzzle generated by the array entered as an argument. The PuzzleGenerator method creates the base double array for interactive mode, and prompts the user to select a difficulty level. It then calls the PuzzleMaker method, which scrambles the base puzzle based on the difficulty level chosen by the user, and finally prints out the scrambled puzzle. 


The gameplay class contains all the methods used for gameplay. The BlockSlider method provides the code needed to move around the 0 in the puzzle according to user input. The GameWon method provides the code needed to check if the puzzle is in ascending order and that 0 is either in the top left or bottom right. The SlidingPuzzle method includes the aforementioned methods. It prompts the user to enter a direction and calls the BlockSlider method according to user input, and calls the GameStart method to check if the user beat the game after every BlockSlider call. The methods used to implement these are GameStart (for interactive mode) and ValidationGameStart.


The InteractiveMode file calls the GameStart method in a main method and nothing else. It’s used to play interactive mode. It contains a main method.


The ValidationMode file calls the ValidationGameStart method in a main method and nothing else. It’s used to play validation mode.
